# Databento

## What Is Databento?

Databento is an **API-first market data platform** that provides programmatic access
to exchange-level tick data, order book snapshots, and OHLCV bars. Unlike Bloomberg
(which centers on a desktop terminal) or LSEG Datastream (which is accessed via
WRDS web queries), Databento is designed from the ground up for developers and
quantitative researchers who want to pull data directly into code.

Key differentiators:

- **Programmatic access**: Python SDK, HTTP API, and raw TCP — no terminal or GUI required.
- **Exchange-level granularity**: Tick-by-tick trades, L2/L3 order book, and
  time-bar aggregations from 1-second to daily.
- **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: Check the exact dollar cost of any query *before*
  executing it, for free.
- **Self-service**: No sales calls or license negotiations.

UChicago has a Databento subscription for FINM students, providing access to
**CME Globex (GLBX.MDP3)** — the electronic trading venue for E-mini S&P 500
futures, Treasury futures, and other major derivatives.

```{admonition} Discussion
:class: tip
How does the pricing model for Databento (pay-per-query) compare to Bloomberg
(terminal subscription) and LSEG Datastream via WRDS (institutional license)?
What are the implications for a research project that requires one-time bulk
historical pulls versus ongoing daily updates?
```

## Key Concepts: Datasets, Schemas, and Symbology

Before writing any code, it helps to understand three organizing concepts in the
Databento data model.

### Datasets

A **dataset** identifies a trading venue. The primary dataset for this course is:

| Dataset | Venue | Products |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `GLBX.MDP3` | CME Globex | E-mini S&P 500, Treasury futures, Eurodollars, and more |

### Symbology

Databento supports multiple ways to refer to the same instrument. This flexibility
is essential when working with futures, which have expiring contracts:

| Symbology Type | Example | Description |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| `raw_symbol` | `ESU4` | One specific contract (ES = E-mini S&P, U = Sep, 4 = 2024) |
| `parent` | `ES.FUT` | All active expirations of a product |
| `continuous` | `ES.c.0` | Rolling front-month contract |
| `instrument_id` | `3403` | Numeric exchange-assigned ID |

For quick reference, here are the **futures month codes**:

| Code | Month | Code | Month |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| F | January | N | July |
| G | February | Q | August |
| H | March | U | September |
| J | April | V | October |
| K | May | X | November |
| M | June | Z | December |

### Schemas

A **schema** controls the level of detail (and volume) of the data returned.
Schemas form a hierarchy from most to least granular:

| Schema | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mbo` | Market-by-order (every order book event) |
| `mbp-10` | Market-by-price, 10 levels |
| `mbp-1` | Market-by-price, top of book |
| `trades` | Every individual trade (tick-by-tick) |
| `ohlcv-1s` | 1-second bars |
| `ohlcv-1m` | 1-minute bars |
| `ohlcv-1h` | 1-hour bars |
| `ohlcv-1d` | Daily bars |

More granular schemas produce more data (and cost more). For most research
projects, `trades` or `ohlcv-1m` are good starting points.

See the
[`05_schemas_and_symbology`](https://github.com/finm-32900/inclass_examples/tree/main/databento/05_schemas_and_symbology)
module in the examples repo for runnable comparisons.

## Getting Started with the Python SDK

### Installation

```bash
pip install databento python-dotenv
```

### API Key Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Databento API key:

```text
DATABENTO_API_KEY=db-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

```{warning}
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure `.env` is in your
`.gitignore`.
```

### Your First Query

The pattern for every historical query is: **create client → check cost → fetch
data → convert to DataFrame**.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import databento as db

load_dotenv()  # reads DATABENTO_API_KEY from .env

client = db.Historical()

# --- Query parameters ---
query = dict(
    dataset="GLBX.MDP3",
    symbols=["ES.FUT"],
    stype_in="parent",
    schema="trades",
    start="2024-08-01",
    end="2024-08-02",
    limit=10,
)

# Step 1: Check cost (free metadata call)
cost = client.metadata.get_cost(**query)
print(f"Estimated cost: ${cost:.4f}")

# Step 2: Fetch data only if the cost is acceptable
data = client.timeseries.get_range(**query)

# Step 3: Convert to pandas DataFrame
df = data.to_df()
print(df)
```

```{warning}
Always check `client.metadata.get_cost()` before calling `get_range()`.
Queries against tick-level schemas over long time ranges or many symbols can
become expensive. The cost check is free and returns the exact dollar amount.
```

## Historical vs. Live Data

Databento provides two modes of access:

- **Historical**: Pull archived data for backtesting and research via
  `db.Historical()`. Billed per query based on data volume.
- **Live**: Stream real-time data as it arrives from the exchange via
  `db.Live()`. Billed per subscription.

Here is a minimal live streaming example:

```python
import databento as db
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = db.Live()

client.subscribe(
    dataset="GLBX.MDP3",
    schema="trades",
    stype_in="parent",
    symbols="ES.FUT",
)

for record in client:
    print(record)  # each record is a TradeMsg with auto-scaled prices
```

```{note}
Live streaming requires CME Globex to be open (Sunday 5 PM – Friday 4 PM CT).
```

For a deeper look at what the SDK does under the hood (raw HTTP requests, TCP
connections, CRAM authentication), see modules
[`02_historical_api`](https://github.com/finm-32900/inclass_examples/tree/main/databento/02_historical_api)
and
[`04_live_raw_tcp`](https://github.com/finm-32900/inclass_examples/tree/main/databento/04_live_raw_tcp)
in the examples repo.

## Case Study: Treasury Futures Market Brief

The
[`06_treasury_futures_brief`](https://github.com/finm-32900/inclass_examples/tree/main/databento/06_treasury_futures_brief)
example in the class repo fetches daily OHLCV data and open interest for five
Treasury futures products spanning the yield curve:

| Symbol | Product | Underlying | Approx. Duration |
|--------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| `ZT` | 2-Year T-Note | UST 2Y | ~1.9 years |
| `ZF` | 5-Year T-Note | UST 5Y | ~4.2 years |
| `ZN` | 10-Year T-Note | UST 10Y | ~6.5 years |
| `TN` | Ultra 10-Year T-Note | UST 10Y (ultra) | ~9.5 years |
| `ZB` | 30-Year T-Bond | UST 30Y | ~17 years |

### Indexed Price Series

The chart below normalizes each product's closing price to 100 at the start of
the sample and tracks relative performance. Products with longer duration
(ZB, TN) show larger price swings — exactly what we expect given the inverse
relationship between bond prices and yields.

```{figure} assets/databento_chart_indexed_prices.png
:alt: Treasury futures indexed prices
:width: 100%

Indexed closing prices (base = 100) for five Treasury futures products.
```

### Volume and Open Interest

Volume and open interest reveal where liquidity concentrates. The 10-Year
T-Note (ZN) typically dominates both metrics, making it the benchmark for
Treasury futures trading.

```{tip}
**Try it yourself.** Clone the
[examples repo](https://github.com/finm-32900/inclass_examples/tree/main/databento)
and run the `06_treasury_futures_brief` scripts to reproduce these charts, add
new products, or extend the date range.

## Comparing Data Sources

```{admonition} Discussion
:class: tip

| | Bloomberg | LSEG Datastream (WRDS) | Databento |
|---|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Access** | Desktop terminal + Excel API | Web queries or Python via WRDS | Python SDK, HTTP API, TCP |
| **Pricing** | Annual terminal license | Institutional license (via WRDS) | Pay-per-query |
| **Strengths** | Breadth (equities, FI, macro, news) | Long historical coverage, cross-asset | Exchange-level tick data, order book |
| **Best for** | Exploratory research, fixed income analytics | Panel data, academic research | Algorithmic trading, microstructure research |
```
