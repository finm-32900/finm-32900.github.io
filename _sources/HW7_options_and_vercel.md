## Assignment

The assignment is located at the following GitHub Classroom link: TBD

This homework focuses on understanding and implementing SPX hedging with options.
For this homework, you simply need to do the following:

1. Complete the SQL query in `src/pull_options_data.py` to pull the SPX options data from WRDS.
Completeing this query should solve the tests in `src/test_spx_hedging_functions.py`.

2. Take the resulting Sphinx site generated in `docs/` and deploy it to Vercel, and protect it from unauthenticated and unauthorized access using Clerk. You can do this using Example 7 from my simple_auth repo here: https://github.com/jmbejara/simple_auth/tree/main/ex7_sphinx_auth

3. Add one of your classmates as an authorized user to your Vercel project.
