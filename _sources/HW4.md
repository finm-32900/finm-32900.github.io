## Learning Outcomes

 - Learn to use GitHub to scan for secrets, to protect against accidental leaks
 - Learn to revise your Git commit history, which is useful in case a secret was accidentally committed to your Git history

## Assignment

The assignment is located at the following GitHub Classroom link: TBD

### Part 1

In order to round out our skills with Github, please complete the following tutorials from the [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) page. Please make sure to use **public repositories** for this in your own GitHub user account. You will provide a link later to demonstrate that it was completed.

 - [Remove commit history](https://github.com/skills/change-commit-history)
 - [Introduction to secret scanning](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-secret-scanning)

You will receive points by add the URL to your completed skills repos from above in the HW repo linked above and by indicating that you have finished this task by marking the unit test as passing.


### Part 2

In the cloned repo, you will see several `test_***.py` files, as
done in previous weeks. However, you will find that most
of the code that implements the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson yield curve
estimation is already provided for you. The main task of this HW,
instead, is for you to pay attention to the format
and construction of the `dodo.py` file. The file
`test_dodo.py` is there to test whether or not your
`dodo.py` file is creating all of the proper files associated
with the project. 


### Part 3 (ungraded)

Please make sure that `dodo.py` produces an Sphinx website that showcases the Jupyter notebooks within the repository. If you have created the `dodo.py` properly, then you should be able to open the file called `index.html` 
in the `docs` folder and see the website.

If you would like, you could try to publish the website to GitHub pages.
