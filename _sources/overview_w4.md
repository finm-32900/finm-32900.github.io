## Learning Outcomes
 
 - Familiarity with using Markdown cells within Jupyter Notebooks
   - Why should I only use Jupyter notebooks for final reports (not as steps within the pipeline)?
   - Familiarity with `nbconvert` to convert notebooks to scripts, HTML, PDFs
   - Using `nbconvert` to execute a notebook from the command line. (Why would we want to do this?)
   - How to fit a notebook into the PyDoit workflow? (Use the workflow set up in my `blank_project` GitHub template repo.)
