# Homework 2



## Part 1 (graded)

In order to continue on our journey mastering the many features of Github, please complete next 2 tutorials from the [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) page. Please make sure to use **public repositories** for this in your own GitHub user account. You will provide a link later to demonstrate that it was completed.

- [Review pull requests](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests) You may want to seek out the help of a friend or teammate with this one.
- [Resolve merge conflicts](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts)

Also, if you're looking for more instruction about how to use Git, here are two videos that I might recommend:
