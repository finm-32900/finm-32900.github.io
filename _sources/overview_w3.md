## Learning Outcomes

 - **Experience using CRSP data** Let's replicate the CRSP value weighted market index and the S&P 500 index.
 - **Task Runners** Now, discuss incorporating automated data downloads into our workflow. Discuss [Build Systems and Task Runners](./Week3/what_is_a_task_runner.md)
 - **Query Automation** We'll then put these two concepts together to demonstrate how to automate a data query from a database.
 - **Basic of SQL** In our query automation discussion, we'll discuss some of the very basics of SQL---enough to allow us to make simple joins in our queries.
