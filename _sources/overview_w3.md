## Learning Outcomes

 - **Task Runners** Now, discuss incorporating automated data downloads into our workflow. Discuss [Build Systems and Task Runners](./Week3/what_is_a_task_runner.md)
 - **Query Automation** We'll then put these two concepts together to demonstrate how to automate a data query from a database.
 - **Project Structure** We'll discuss the structure of the "chartbook project" template and how to use it to create a new project. Mention my older template that is now deprecated.
 - **Overview of my "Financial Times Series Forecasting Repository"** I will discuss the structure of my repository and how to use it to obtain a variety of useful financial time series data.

## Agenda

- Discuss [Potential Final Projects](./FinalProject/potential_final_projects.md). I will send an email out with a survey to select the projects. Please find your project partner. Each group must have exactly 2 people. Only have one person per group submit responses to the survey. I will try to make sure that each group is assigned a project that is of interest to them.
