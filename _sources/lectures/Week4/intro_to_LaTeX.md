# Introduction to LaTeX

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX (pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech") is a typesetting system commonly used for the production of scientific and mathematical documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographies. Unlike typical word processors, LaTeX is not a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) system. Instead, it is a WYSIWYW (What You See is What You Want) system.
It functions more like a markup language, similar to HTML.

Can you think of examples of WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYW systems? Have we encountered some of each already in this class?

In LaTeX, the author uses plain text combined with markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylize text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. The primary focus and strength of LaTeX is the creation of well-formatted mathematical expressions and scientific documentation. 

Here's an example of how LaTeX can be used to write a mathematical expression:

```latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} 
+ rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0
\end{equation}
```

This snippet of LaTeX code will produce a formatted equation for part of the Black–Scholes equation governing the price evolution of derivatives under the Black–Scholes model.
It will be rendered like this:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + 
rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0
$$

LaTeX is widely used in academia, especially in fields that require the use of complex formulas and diagrams, such as physics, mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, and quantitative finance. The quality and readability of documents produced with LaTeX, particularly the way it handles formulas, tables, and references, are considered to be better than what can be easily achieved with standard word processors.

Furthermore, LaTeX and other programmatically generated documents can be useful for incorporating automatically generated charts and tables into reports. It enables automation in updating charts when underlying data changes, streamlining the report generation process.

## An Overview of How to Use LaTeX

First, let's start with a high level overview of the initial steps to using LaTex, including setting up a LaTeX environment, creating your first document, and understanding the basic structure.

### Step 1: Install a LaTeX Distribution
To begin using LaTeX, you need to install a LaTeX distribution. For Windows, a popular choice is MiKTeX or TeXLive (in this class, we have required TeX Live); for macOS, MacTeX is recommended; and for Linux, TeX Live is widely used.

### Step 2: Choose a Text Editor
After installing the distribution, select a text editor to write your LaTeX code. Some popular choices include TeXworks, TeXstudio, TeXmaker, and Overleaf (an online editor). TeXworks comes prepackaged with TeX Live, so we will use that. Also, note that you can use your normal text editor, like VS Code. LaTeX can be compiled from the command line. All you need is something to edit the text of the `.tex` files. However, note that editors like VS Code, or Sublime Text have extentions that make it very easy to work with LaTeX documents.

### Step 3: Create Your First Document
Open your text editor and start with a basic document. Here's a simple example:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, World!
\end{document}
```

This code creates a basic document with the phrase "Hello, World!"

### Step 4: Understanding the Basic Structure
- `\documentclass{article}`: This line specifies the type of document you're creating - in this case, an article. Other types include `book`, `report`, etc.
- `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`: These lines mark the beginning and end of the content in your document.
- The text between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` is where you will write the content of your document.

### Step 5: Compile Your Document
To view your document, you need to compile it:
- In a standalone editor, there's usually a button to compile the document.
- In Overleaf, the document compiles automatically.

The output will be a PDF file displaying "Hello, World!"

### Step 6: Explore Basic Formatting
Start experimenting with basic formatting commands like `\textbf{}` for bold text, `\textit{}` for italics, and `\\` for a new line.

### Step 7: Preview and Debug
After making changes, compile and preview the document. If there are errors, the compiler will provide messages to help you debug.

## Conclusion
This is just the beginning. LaTeX is a powerful tool with capabilities extending far beyond basic text formatting, including complex mathematical formulas, tables, figures, and bibliographies. As you become more familiar with LaTeX, you can explore more advanced features to suit your specific needs. 

Remember, the learning curve for LaTeX can be steep at the beginning, but the control and quality of the output it offers are unmatched.
