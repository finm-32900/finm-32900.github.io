# Homework 3

## Part 0 (not graded)

Please watch the following videos to better familiarize yourself with CRSP and Compustat in WRDS.

 - Watch the CRSP and Compustat videos linked in the class notes from earlier, [found here.](WRDS_intro_and_web_queries.md)
 - [CRSP Coverage](https://vimeo.com/417302309)
 - [CRSP - Useful Variale](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/grid-items/crsp-useful-variables/)
   - This video goes over some points we made in class as well and is helpful for cleaning the CRSP data (e.g., negative prices).
 - [CRSP Stock Database Coverage](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/grid-items/crsp-stock-database-structure/)
   - Useful for merging stock files and event files in CRSP via SQL. This is useful, for example, to incorporate delisting returns.
