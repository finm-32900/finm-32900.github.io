# Week 2: Env Files and Secrets

## Objectives

- No class on Jan 20 because of holiday. I will hold a make-up class on Friday, January 24 during the TA office hours.
This will be on Zoom. See the Zoom link on the Canvas calendar. I will use the same Zoom link as the TA office hours.
- Review [HW 1](../Week1/HW1.md):
  - Even with precise instructions, replicating results exactly is still hard. 
  - The manual data download step is one common source of error. In today's lecture,
  we'll learn how to automate the data download step, which will go a long way
  towards fixing this problem.
  - The test-driven development workflow is common workflow in the real world.
  Learning how to write and debug unit tests is an important career skill.
  - Lots of other coding classes restrict your coding to a single windows in a
  browser, like LeetCode. This course gives you a more realistic context for
  writing code.
  - Getting used to incorporating Git and GitHub into your workflow is also an
  important career skill. 
- [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) portion of [HW 1](../Week1/HW1.md):
    - Review this section of the HW. 
    - I will check this for completion. Everyone should make sure to complete these.
    - Learning GitHub is a core skill in this class. It is of upmost importance
    for an aspiring software developer or data scientist.
    - Future assignments will contain additional GitHub skill-building exercises. 
    These tutorials created by GitHub are a great resource, but I will augment these
    with some of my own exercises.
- Review "Virtual Environments" from [Week 1](../Week1/virtual_environments.md)
- Given the motivation for automating data downloads and the inspiration to create various financial reports, let's discuss the main platform for data that we'll use in this course: WRDS. 
  - [Introduction to WRDS and WRDS Web Queries](./WRDS_intro_and_web_queries.md) 
  - [Demo of the WRDS Python package](../../output/_01_wrds_python_package.ipynb).
- Discuss `.env` files and secretes, and how to use them in our workflow. See [Env Files](./env_files.md)
- CRSP value weighted index example
- Discuss [HW 2](./HW2.md)
