- Learn to publish live, automatically updating dashboards using Jupyter, Sphinx, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Assignment

The assignment is located at the following GitHub Education link: https://classroom.github.com/a/F2vSH9AI

### Part 1

In order to round out our skills with Github, please complete the following tutorials from the [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) page. Please make sure to use **public repositories** for this in your own GitHub user account. You will provide a link later to demonstrate that it was completed.

 - [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions)
 - [Test with Actions](https://github.com/skills/test-with-actions)

You will receive points by add the URL to your completed skills repos from above in the HW repo linked above and by indicating that you have finished this task by marking the unit test as passing.


### Part 2

You will receive points by add the URL to your page in the linked repo and by indicating that you have finished this task by marking the unit test as passing.

For this HW, please create a website like the demo discussed on the last day of class. See the example from class here (https://jeremybejarano.com/example-updating-dashboard/index.html) along with the accompanying code here (https://github.com/jmbejara/example-updating-dashboard).

You only need to make **minor** modifications to the site just to demonstrate that you have the ability to "make it your own." You don't actually need to change much. Just demonstrate that you know how to deploy the site and make minor changes. Therefore, please do the following:

 - Change the name of the website. The URL of the website is based off of the name of the GitHub repository, so change the name to something else (choose any name you like).
 - Change the title of the web page to something else. Right now the title on the front page says this: "Welcome to My Blank Projectâ€™s documentation!"
 - Change the logo. This is the current logo: https://jeremybejarano.com/example-updating-dashboard/_static/logo.png
 - Change one of the plots on this page to anything else: https://jeremybejarano.com/example-updating-dashboard/_notebook_build/_03_pca_index_dashboard.html

That's it! It's fine to make minimal changes. Hopefully this is enough just to demonstrate that you can do these core tasks. -->
