## Assignment

### Part 1

In order to start mastering the many features of Github, please complete the following tutorials from the [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) page. Please make sure to use **public repositories** for this in your own GitHub user account. You will provide a link later to demonstrate that it was completed.

 - [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
 - [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)
 - [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)
 
These tutorials are not graded, but please make sure to complete them before the next class.

### Part 2

Next, a coding assignment is located at the following GitHub Education link: https://classroom.github.com/a/uDoKANYN

The assignments follow a test-driven development approach. Your objective is to write the code that passes all the tests.
You should run `pytest` to check if your code passes all the tests. When you are ready to submit, you can push your changes to the repository and submit the assignment on GitHub Classroom. Every time you push your changes, the tests will be run again on GitHub and your assignment will be graded. You can submit as many times as you want until the deadline. Each time you submit, you will be regraded.
